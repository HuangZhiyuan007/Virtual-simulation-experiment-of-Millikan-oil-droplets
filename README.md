# Virtual-simulation-experiment-of-Millikan-oil-droplets
This program is coded in javascript. And it is an entry for National College Students Physics Experiment Innovation Competition. I am mainly responsible for the code part in the team. The program simulates the Millikan oil drop experiment.
The pictures are the used in start.html file. The program can still work without these pictures. But to show theese pictures, we should download them and create a file called "asset" to  store them.
Also, it is a competition in China so the language is Chinese.
